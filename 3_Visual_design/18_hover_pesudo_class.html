<!--  
  What are Pseudo-classes?
  A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

  For example, it can be used to:

  Style an element when a user mouses over it
  Style visited and unvisited links differently
  Style an element when it gets focus

  syntax: (DO NOT HAVE SPACE between selector:pseudo-class)
  selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
  }

  selector.class:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
  } 

  html-tag:pseudo-class class {
    display: block;
  }

  Note: 
  " a:hover " MUST come after " a:link " and " a:visited " in the CSS definition in order to be effective! 
  " a:active " MUST come after " a:hover " in the CSS definition in order to be effective! 
  Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.
