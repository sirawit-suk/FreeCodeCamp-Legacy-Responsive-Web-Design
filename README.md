# FreeCodeCamp-Legacy-Responsive-Web-Design

## This is my certificate : [Responsive Web Design - Sirawit Sukwattanavit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/popeyeza12/responsive-web-design)

This is the same certificate as "New Responsive Web Design" course.
but I have to update my knowledge to the new course because they have created so many interesting new lessons to learn.

By the way, I have learned from this course a lot... before I become an intern as full-stack developer. :)
